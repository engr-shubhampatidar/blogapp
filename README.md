# BlogoFile App

#### I have created a blog app in which the user can register, login and logout and after that, create the blog and view the blogs. and also he can like and dislike. For this app, I used Express, Mysql, Knex, and JWT for authentication:

      -Register using email & password ( use JWT for authentication )
      -Login
      -Logout
      -Create a post
      -See all posts from other users on home page
      -Like/Dislike a post
      -see how many likes/dislikes a post have in realtime
      
## Required technologies:

      -NodeJS
      -JWT
      -Knex
      -Body-Parser
      -Mysql
